        <h2>1. No Insurance Services Provided</h2>
        <p>High-Risk Car Insurance Calculator is an informational website only. We do not sell insurance, provide insurance quotes, act as insurance agents or brokers, or facilitate the purchase of insurance policies. We are not affiliated with any insurance company.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Informational Estimates Only</h2>
        <p>All insurance cost estimates provided by our calculator are for informational and educational purposes only. These estimates are based on simplified calculations and general statistical data.

        <h2>3. Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>While we strive to provide reasonably accurate estimates based on publicly available data, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability of the estimates provided. Actual insurance rates may vary significantly based on numerous factors not considered in our calculations.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Factors Not Considered</h2>
        <p>Our calculator does not consider all factors that insurance companies use to determine actual rates, including but not limited to:
